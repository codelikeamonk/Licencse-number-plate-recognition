# License Number Plate Recognition using Deep Learning
This project aims to recognize license number plates.

# Tools
OpenCV, Python Pytesseract

# Summary
Developed a deep learning project to recognize license number plate. 

Discussed some important features of openCV like Gaussian blur, Sobel operators, Morphological transformations. 

The application detects number plate text from an image.
